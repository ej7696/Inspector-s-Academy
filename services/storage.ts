// This file previously contained functions to interact with localStorage for history and pro status.
// That functionality has been moved into `services/userData.ts` and `services/authService.ts`
// to support the new user-based authentication and data storage model.
// This file is now empty but is kept to prevent import errors in case it's referenced elsewhere,
// though it should ideally be removed in a future cleanup.
